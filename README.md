# FABLE GALAXY // Deep Field Command

An interactive, multi-scale 3D galaxy explorer with a sci-fi cockpit aesthetic.
Pure ES modules + [three.js](https://threejs.org) from a CDN import map, **no
build step**. Procedural worlds are drawn on canvas at runtime; the real Sol
system uses public [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures)
imagery (CC BY 4.0, see [textures/CREDITS.md](textures/CREDITS.md)), synthesized
WebAudio for the ambient soundscape and UI, and a small build script for the
star catalogs.

## Running it

Serve the folder with any static file server and open `index.html`:

```sh
cd fable-galaxy
python3 -m http.server 8741
# → http://localhost:8741/
```

(Modules can't load over `file://`, so a server is required.)

## What it is

Three nested scales, seamlessly connected:

- **System view** — you start in **Sol**, running on **real JPL ephemerides**
  (Keplerian elements + centennial rates): the date readout shows where the
  planets truly are. Saturn's rings, moons, the asteroid belt, and a
  long-period comet whose tail always points away from the star.
- **Galaxy view** — zoom all the way out (or `ESC` / GALAXY MAP) and ascend
  to a procedural spiral galaxy: ~80,000 stars on four logarithmic arms with
  bulge, halo, dust lanes and nebulae, via a custom point shader.
- **Low orbit** — descend to any solid world: seeded fBm terrain, water
  shells, cloud decks and a rim-glow atmosphere, generated on arrival.

Thirty-two catalogued destinations, including:

- **Confirmed exoplanet systems** (NASA Exoplanet Archive data, inlined):
  TRAPPIST-1's seven worlds, Proxima b/d, Kepler-186b–f, 51 Peg b,
  HD 209458 b, Gliese 581, Tau Ceti, Epsilon Eridani — real radii, masses,
  periods and equilibrium temperatures.
- **Sagittarius A*** — supermassive black hole with accretion disk, photon
  ring, and the real S-cluster stars (S2, S38, S55) on their eccentric orbits.
- **PSR B1257+12** — a millisecond pulsar with sweeping beams and the first
  exoplanets ever discovered (Draugr, Poltergeist, Phobetor, 1992).
- **Binary systems** — Alpha Centauri B and the white dwarf Sirius B orbit
  inside their system views.
- Everything else is generated deterministically from the star's name.

And on top of the map:

- **Event Horizon** — predicted conjunctions and comet perihelia, found by
  root-finding over the (pure-function-of-time) positions; click to jump the
  clock to the event.
- **Mission planner** — plot a Hohmann transfer between any two planets; the
  launch window is solved numerically (Earth→Mars resolves to the real
  late-2028 window), then a probe flies the arc. Fully time-reversible.
- **Captain's log** — visited systems persist in localStorage; unvisited
  stars are UNSURVEYED fog-of-war until you jump in and scan them.
- **Guided tours** — narrated camera choreography: *The Grand Tour* (Sol)
  and *Galactic Landmarks* (Sgr A*, the pulsar, TRAPPIST-1).
- **Deep links** — every view is a shareable URL: `#/trappist-1/e`,
  `#/sol/mars/orbit?t=500`, `#/galaxy`.
- **Night-sky mode** (`#/sol/earth/sky`) — stand on Earth and see the *real*
  sky for the simulation date: 6,000 HYG stars, the IAU constellation
  figures, and the Sun, Moon and planets placed geocentrically from the same
  ephemerides that drive the orrery. Drag to look around, scroll to zoom
  FOV, fast-forward to wheel the sky through the night.
- **Real neighbourhood geometry** — the 30 catalog stars sit at their true
  J2000 directions (log-compressed distances), surrounded by a point cloud
  of the actual sub-25 pc solar neighbourhood colored by B−V index.
- **Photometer** — a live transit light curve along your line of sight.
  Align TRAPPIST-1 edge-on and watch the flux dips that discovered it.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Drag | Orbit the view |
| Scroll | Zoom (zoom far out of a system to ascend to the galaxy) |
| Click planet / star | Fly to it, open the data panel |
| Click empty space | Return to overview |
| Click galaxy star ×2 | Hyperjump into its system |
| `ESC` | Step up one level (planet → system → galaxy) |
| `Space` | Pause / resume time |
| Bottom scrubber | Time rate, exponential from −1580 to +1580 days/sec |

### Design notes

- **Distances are compressed, periods are real.** True orbital spacing
  (0.4 AU vs 30 AU) collapses inner systems into a pixel; spacing is
  hand-tuned while orbital *speeds* keep their real ratios — Mercury laps
  Neptune ~684× per Neptune year, and you can watch that at high time rates.
- **Determinism.** All procedural content (galaxy, textures, exosystems) is
  seeded. No `Math.random()` in world-gen paths; revisiting a star reproduces
  its system exactly.
- **Graceful failure.** No WebGL, no CDN, no import-map support — each path
  lands on a readable "RENDER LINK FAILURE" panel instead of a black screen.
  Post-processing bloom (UnrealBloomPass) loads as an optional enhancement;
  if the addons import fails, the additive-sprite glow pipeline stands alone.
- **Lifecycle.** Each `SystemView` owns its scene and disposes geometry,
  materials and textures on exit; the galaxy scene is built once and kept.
